create new object that
- builds a Universe from a board of 0 and 1
- build a board of 0 and 1 from a Universe

- use constants instead of symbols for Cell status?

- add more tests to GameOfLife test class?

Universe does the following things:

- assigns neighbour status to each cell
- ticks all the cells
- creates a board with 0 and 1 out of his cells

is it doing too many things?
